# vr-anchoring



Anchors (steam) VR to the lighthouses, regardless of Guardian settings.

This can be utilized to "anchor" the VR headset to the physical room.



Unfortunately, slight offsets can still occur on every boot.

This offset can be anywhere between 1 to 40 cm (Rough estimates based on measurements by eye)
